## BrainyBackTest
This project focuses on creating a tool for testing trading strategies using TradingView's charts. The aim is to overcome the limitations of current testing tools.

In the financial world, it's crucial to understand that traders' behaviors and views evolve over time. To succeed in trading, you need fresh and innovative ideas. Most trading platforms, like TradingView and MetaQuotes, are closed systems, which means there are concerns that they might take developers' ideas without permission. That's why this project is being developed as an open-source tool, allowing anyone to test their trading ideas and potentially profit from them.

By combining the programming principles of MetaTrader5  with the visually appealing charts of TradingView, this project aims to provide a robust tool for analyzing and evaluating trading strategies.

Lastly, there have been rumors circulating online about TradingView and MetaQuotes potentially using developers' ideas without consent. It's advisable to research these claims further before forming any conclusions about their practices.
