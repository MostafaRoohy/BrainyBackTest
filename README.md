# BrainyBackTest
Backtesting with TradingView charting and visualization capabilities, addressing limitations present in current backtesting solutions.


Well, if you are a darwinism, then you know market's participants' psychology and trading views will change over time. That's how trading edge works, only new unique ideas will make money.
And I think TradingView or MetaQuotes developed such platforms as closed source so they see the ideas background.
That's why I've build this open source projects, so everyone can test their ideas and let their hard-worked idea make money.

I've combined MT5's programming Principle with TradingView's beautiful charts. Now we have both of their powers.

BTW, let's not talk about all creepy rumors on forums about TradingView or MetaQuotes.
